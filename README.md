# Python-FastAPI

This is my first contact with FastAPI, this code was fully based in the video [FastAPI Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLKKmouUams) from youtube channel **freeCodeCamp.org**.

## What was learned here:
- Installation and Creating Your First API
- Path Parameters
- Query Parameters
- Combining Path and Query Parameters
- Request Body and The Post Method
- Put Method
- Delete Method

Even following the code presented in the video I did some little changes to test my knowledge.
